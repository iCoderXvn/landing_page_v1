# Admin Panel Fixes - Round 2 Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Fixed 401 Errors on `/api/users` and `/api/settings`

**Problem:**
- Users and Settings pages were making API calls before authentication was verified
- Getting 401 Unauthorized errors on page load

**Solution:**
- Added authentication check in `useEffect` before making API calls
- Check for both `authToken` and `adminSession` in localStorage
- Redirect to `/admin` login if not authenticated
- Added `isAuthenticated` state and conditional rendering
- Prevents API calls until user is verified

**Files Modified:**
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/settings/page.tsx`

---

### ✅ 2. Added Telegram to Social Media Settings

**Problem:**
- Telegram URL was missing from social media settings

**Solution:**
- Added `telegramUrl` state variable
- Added Telegram field to settings UI (after YouTube)
- Added `telegram_url` to loadSettingsToState switch
- Added `telegram_url` to save settings array
- Updated default settings in database to include telegram_url

**Files Modified:**
- `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - UI and state management
- `lib/database.ts` - Default settings initialization

**UI Location:**
Settings → Social Media Tab → Telegram field

### ✅ 3. Made Settings Affect Entire Website

**Problem:**
- Settings were only stored in database but not used across the site
- No way for frontend pages to access settings

**Solution:**

**Created Settings Infrastructure:**

1. **Settings Utility** (`lib/settings.ts`):
   - `getSiteSettings()` - Fetch all settings as structured object
   - `getSetting(key, default)` - Get single setting value
   - Type-safe `SiteSettings` interface

2. **Public API Endpoint** (`app/api/settings/public/route.ts`):
   - GET endpoint without authentication requirement
   - Returns public-safe settings (excludes sensitive data like analytics IDs)
   - Available at `/api/settings/public`

3. **React Hook** (`hooks/use-settings.tsx`):
   - `useSettings()` hook for client components
   - Auto-fetches settings on mount
   - Provides loading state
   - Falls back to default values

**Usage Examples:**

```typescript
// In any client component
import { useSettings } from '@/hooks/use-settings';

function MyComponent() {
  const { settings, loading } = useSettings();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{settings.siteName}</h1>
      <a href={settings.telegramUrl}>Telegram</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```typescript
// In API routes or server components
import { getSiteSettings, getSetting } from '@/lib/settings';

const settings = getSiteSettings();
const siteName = getSetting('site_name', 'Default Name');
```

**Available Settings:**
- Site: name, description, URL, contact email
- Social: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube, Telegram
- Content: posts per page, enable comments, allow guest posts
- System: maintenance mode, date format, timezone

### ✅ 4. Fixed Top Posts View Count Showing Double

**Problem:**
- Top Performing Posts in analytics showed views twice as high as actual
- Caused by counting from `page_views` table which had all tracking events

**Root Cause:**
- Posts were being tracked in TWO places:
  1. `view_count` column in `posts` table (incremented by blog API)
  2. `page_views` table (tracked by AnalyticsTracker)
- Analytics query was counting ALL entries in `page_views` including duplicates

**Solution:**
- Modified `getTopPosts()` query in `lib/database.ts`:
  - For period-based queries: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT pv.id)` to avoid duplicates
  - For all-time stats: Use `view_count` column from posts table (more accurate)
  - Both methods now count unique visitors correctly

**Query Logic:**
```sql
-- With period filter (e.g., last 7 days)
COUNT(DISTINCT pv.id) as views  -- Unique page view entries
COUNT(DISTINCT pv.visitor_id) as unique_visitors

-- Without period (all-time)
p.view_count as views  -- From posts table
COUNT(DISTINCT pv.visitor_id) as unique_visitors
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/database.ts` - analyticsOperations.getTopPosts()

## Summary of Changes

- Added `telegram_url` to default settings initialization

### New Files Created:
- `lib/settings.ts` - Settings utility functions
- `app/api/settings/public/route.ts` - Public settings API
- `hooks/use-settings.tsx` - React hook for settings

### Modified Files:
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Authentication guard
- `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Authentication guard + Telegram field
- `lib/database.ts` - Fixed getTopPosts query + telegram default

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Fix:**
   - Try accessing `/admin/users` without being logged in
   - Should redirect to `/admin` login
   - Should not show 401 errors

2. **Telegram Setting:**
   - Go to `/admin/settings` → Social Media tab
   - Add a Telegram URL (e.g., `https://t.me/yourchannel`)
   - Save settings
   - Verify it persists after page reload

3. **Settings Usage:**
   - Use the `useSettings()` hook in any component
   - Verify settings load correctly
   - Check `/api/settings/public` endpoint returns data

4. **View Count Fix:**
   - Check analytics dashboard `/admin/analytics`
   - Verify Top Performing Posts shows correct view counts
   - Compare with actual post view counts in database
